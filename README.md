# Welcome to NotesAi! 🎉🎉🎉

Hey there! Thanks for checking out my project! What we have here is a **virtual study room!** 🔥🔥🔥

# Functions ⚒️

 -  You can write notes with a modern google docs like text editor
 -  You can click ALT to auto complete your notes 🔥
 -  NoteGPT will **answer questions about your notes and manipulate your notes**!
 -  You can also turn your notes into **Flashcardss**
 -  You can also listen to **Lofi Music**

# What I used ⚙️

I used the following functionalities to develop our project-

 - Svelte
 - Open AI
 - JavaScript
 - HTML
 - Tailwind CSS, Bulma CSS, and Daisy UI
 - Google Firebase
 - Quill JS
 

# How it works ⚙️

 - I used firebase auth to make accounts and log in
 - The users info and notes are stored in firestore
 - I use GPT3 to autocomplete the notes when you click ALT
 - Using a cool prompt to generate json I made NoteGPT Work
 - The Lofi Music is just *Stolen* cough. cough. I mean *Borrowed* from Freecodecamp

# Things I would change in the future 🧐
- Make my Firebase and Open AI credentials be private and as enviorment values ( I was too lazy )
- Improve Flashcards option
- Add collaboration
